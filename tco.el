;;; Commentary:
;; tco.el provides tail-call optimisation for functions in elisp that
;; call themselves in tail-position.

;; It works by replacing each self-call with a thunk, and wrapping the
;; function body in a loop that repeatedly evaluates the thunk.  Roughly
;; speaking, a function `foo':

;; \(defun-tco foo (...)
;;   (...)
;;   (foo (...)))

;; Is rewritten as follows:

;; \(defun foo (...)
;;    (flet (foo-thunk (...)
;;                (...)
;;                (lambda () (foo-thunk (...))))
;;      (let ((result (apply foo-thunk (...))))
;;        (while (functionp result)
;;          (setq result (funcall result)))
;;        result)))

;;; Code:

(require 'dash)
(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))

(setq lexical-binding t)

;; TODO: handle &rest in FUN-SPEC too.
(defun tco--call->assignment (form fun-spec)
  "Given a quoted FORM that represents a recursive call, rewrite as assignment.
FUN-SPEC is the argument list for the original recursive function.

Example: We rewrite:
  (foo x (+ y 1))
To:
  (setq bar x baz (+ y 1))"
  (let ((arg-names (--filter (not (equal '&optional it)) fun-spec))
        (actual-args (rest form)))
    `(setq ,@(-interleave arg-names actual-args))))

(defun tco-add-trampoline (fun-name new-name form)
  "Given quoted source FORM, replace calls to FUN-NAME (a symbol)
with a lambda expression that returns the result of the FUN-NAME call."
  (--map

         `(lambda () (,new-name ,@(cdr it)))
       (tco-add-trampoline fun-name new-name it)))
    ('t it))
